# MDP-MultiGraph
1. Using multigraph to solve the Markov decision problem for rod-navigation in a maze
2. Solution::optimize() contains the algorithm that can be adapted to other specific problems. 
3. Solution::simulate() contains the routine to do MCMC simulation to get the probability density as a function of time under optimal control.
